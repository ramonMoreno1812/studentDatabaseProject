# studentDatabaseProject

This project is a simple web app that allows a user to enter a students information through html templates (using thymeleafe).
this information is passed to the backend and a student object is created and uploaded into a MySql database.
Using the Spring Framework this program is created 100% with the eclipse IDE.
A similar project to this exists in my repos, but the front end in that project is created with React and not thymeleage templates as in this project.


*NOTE in order to run this project a database must fist be created in MySql workbench. All the available info for that connection
can be found in my applications folder in this project.
